        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dave grew up playing rock guitar, with lots of Allman Brothers and Pink Floyd in his diet. After having his ears opened up by Phish, he began a deep dive into jazz performance and eventually shifted his focus to composition full-time.
          
          Dave writes acoustic percussion music and produces electronic dance tracks, always with attention to groove and expressive timbres. He advocates for a more inclusive, polystylistic approach to music education, free of the structural racism and stylistic limitations of traditional music theory pedagogy. 
        
          He has a Ph.D in music composition from Princeton University and was an Assistant Professor of composition and theory at Georgetown (2016-2019), 
          where he developed a completely new curriculum based on stylistic diversity and social justice. Daveâ€™s music has been performed widely by groups 
          such as So Percussion, Sandbox Percussion, Third Coast Percussion, Jack Quartet, and Decoda Ensemble. 
        
          His writing has appeared in<a href="https://www.icareifyoulisten.com" target="_blank"><em> I Care If You Listen</em></a>, <a href="https://nmbx.newmusicusa.org/" target="_blank"><em>New Music Box</em></a>, <a href="https://soundstudiesblog.com/" target="_blank"><em>Sounding Out!</em></a>, and <a href="https://iupress.org/journals/itr/" target="_blank"><em>Indiana Theory Review</em></a>.
